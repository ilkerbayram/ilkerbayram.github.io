%% EHB 372E Week-6 : The Short-Time Fourier Transform
%
% For analyzing audio signals, the time domain and the frequency domain
% representations may be used for different tasks but for some applications
% we need a representation that jointly represents the time-frequency
% information. The short-time Fourier transform can be used for this
% purpose. The STFT consists of the DFTs of portions of the time-domain
% signal. We will be interested in the STFT of audio signals, so let us
% first see how to read an audio signal. We will work with .wav files.

%% Audio Input 
%
% For reading in audio, we use the function 'wavread'. Let us read the file
% 'Glock.wav'. This is a short melody played by a glockenspiel.

[x,fs] = wavread('Glock.wav');
%%
% Here 'x' contains the samples of the audio signal and fs is the sampling
% frequency. Note that we need to know 'fs' to properly play the audio.
% To hear what 'x' sounds like, use the function 'soundsc'. Do not forget
% to provide 'fs'.

soundsc(x,fs);
%% 
% To understand why 'fs' is important, try the following.

soundsc(x,fs/2);
%%
% Now try doubling 'fs'.

soundsc(x,2*fs);

%%
% What would happen if you played speech with a wrong 'fs'? (you can try it on 'matematik.wav')

%% Viewing Audio
% Now that we know how to read in audio to Matlab, let us discuss how to visualize audio.
% Let us plot the function in the time domain
figure;
plot(x);
axis tight; % this discards the unnecessary white space
%%
% Notice that the unit of the x-axis is 'samples'. But these samples are
% related to time. It might be preferable to use 'seconds' as the
% time unit. To convert, we need to use the sampling frequency 'fs'. Note that
% there are 'fs' samples in a second. So, if the length of the signal is N
% samples, the total duration of the signal should be N/fs seconds. 
t = (0:length(x)-1)/fs;
plot(t,x);
axis tight;
xlabel('seconds');
%%
% We now see that the signal duration is about 6 seconds.
% Notice that from the time domain representation, we can see where the
% notes start and end. But it is not easy to see which particular notes are being
% played. That is, the contents of the notes are not visible when we view the
% time-domain signal. For that, we need a frequency domain image. We can
% obtain a frequency domain image with FFT or freqz.

[H,W] = freqz(x); % try 'help freqz' to see what H and W is
plot(W,abs(H));
axis tight;

%%
% Here, the frequency unit is 'radians/sample'. But we would like to see 'Hertz'.
% To convert 'rad/sample' to 'Hz', remember that the highest frequency for a discrete time signal is $\pi$ rad/sample and it corresponds
% to 'fs/2' Hz. 
f = (fs/2)*W/pi;
plot(f/1000,abs(H));
axis tight;
xlabel('KHz');

%% 
% The frequency unit is now Hz. We can see some peaks, which actually correspond to notes, but it's not
% easy to say which of these occur when. STFT comes into play at this
% point. Here's what we would like to do this week.

win = hamming(50*fs/1000); % analysis window of length 50 msec.
hop = round(length(win)/4); % the hop-size
win = NormalizeW(win,hop); % this step you will skip

X = STFT(x,win,hop); % this is my STFT function, you'll write your own
%%
% X contains the STFT coefficients. It is a time-frequency representation
% and may be regarded as an image. We can display its magnitude using
% 'imagesc' (we will display its magnitude only, the phase is important too
% but the magnitude usually provides enough visual information to understand the signal content).

imagesc( abs( X ) );
%%
% We don't see much in this image, but the information is actually there. With audio, the logarithm of the magnitude is visually more revealing.

imagesc( log( abs( X ) ) );


%%
% This is much better but it is still not easy to interpret 
% because the axes are not properly labeled and negative and positive frequencies are present in the same image. Below is what
% you get when you properly zoom in and label.

%some preparation for displaying the STFT coefficients
Fr = [0 8000]; % the frequency range to view
clim = [-50 0]; % the amplitude range to view (in decibels)

DispSTFT(X/max(abs(X(:))), fs, length(win), hop, Fr, clim); % this is my display function, you'll write your own

%%
% We can now see which note occurs when. 
% This week, you will implement an STFT function, a display function, and
% the inverse STFT function.

%% The STFT : How to implement
% The idea in STFT is to take a small chunk using a window, compute its DFT and place it
% as the column of a matrix. Then, you move the window a little and compute
% the DFT again.
% We will collect the STFT coefficients into  the matrix Z.
% Here is the first step. 

N = 40*fs/1000;
win = hamming(N);
F = fft( x(1:N) .* win );
Z = F; %F is the first column of Z

%%
% The next column is obtained by sliding the window by 'hop' samples.
% This is also referred to as the 'hop-size'.
F = fft( x( hop + (1:N) ) .* win ); % this is equivalent to sliding the window
Z(:,2) = F;

%% 
% You see the pattern ...
F = fft( x( 2*hop + (1:N) ) .* win ); % this is equivalent to sliding the window
Z(:,3) = F;


%%
% This is continued until you reach the end of 'x'. 
% Write a function called STFT which can be called as above.

%% Inverting the STFT
% The STFT representation is useful because it allows us to obtain
% interesting effects via simple operations on the STFT coefficients.
% So, when processing a signal with the STFT, the idea is to compute the STFT coefficients, modify the 
% coefficients and then invert the STFT to obtain the modified signal in
% the time domain. We now discuss how to invert the STFT.
%
% Recall that the columns of Z hold the DFTs of the segments of x, modified
% by a window. For instance, we can obtain samples of x
% multipllied by a sliding window as follows.

y1 = ifft( Z(:,1) ); % the first N samples multiplied by the window
y2 = ifft( Z(:,2) ); % the samples in between ( hop + (1:N) ) multiplied by the window.
y3 = ifft( Z(:,3) ); % the samples in between ( 2*hop + (1:N) ) multiplied by the window.
%%
% In an attempt to reconstruct x, we combine these pieces as follows.
y = zeros(N + 2*hop,1);
y(1:N) = y1;
y( hop + (1:N) ) = y( hop + (1:N) ) + y2;
y( 2*hop + (1:N) ) = y( 2*hop + (1:N) ) + y3;

%%
% We would like y to be equal to the first samples of x but this is not the
% case. We need to take into account the windowing. In fact y can be seen
% to be equal to a masked version of x. The mask can be constructed similar
% to y.

mask = zeros(N + 2*hop,1);
mask(1:N) = win;
mask( hop + (1:N) ) = mask( hop + (1:N) ) + win;
mask( 2*hop + (1:N) ) = mask( 2*hop + (1:N) ) + win;

z = x( 1:(N+2*hop) ) .* mask; % we claim that z is equal to y

max( abs (y - z) ) % check the claim REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH the result should be numerically zero...

%% 
% Write a function called ISTFT that takes as input the STFT coefficients,
% the window used for the STFT and the hop size. Check that your function
% correctly recovers the original signal when the STFT coefficients are not
% modified.

win = hamming(50*fs/1000); 
hop = round(length(win)/4);
win = NormalizeW(win,hop); 
X = STFT(x,win,hop); 

z = ISTFT(X,win,hop);

plot(x);
hold on;
plot( abs( x-z(1:length(x)) ),'r');
axis tight;
