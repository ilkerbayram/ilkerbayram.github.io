If we need a bandpass or highpass filter, we can shift the frequency response of the filter in the frequency domain via modulation. That is, suppose $h(k)$ is a given filter and $g(k) = e^{-j\omega_0 k}\,h(k)$, where $\omega_0$ is the modulation frequency. Then, the frequency responses of $h$ and $g$ are related as, $$ G(e^{j\omega}) = H(e^{j(\omega - \omega_0}).$$ It follows that if $g(k) = \cos(\omega_0 k)\,h(k)$, then, $$ G(e^{j\omega}) = \frac{1}{2} \bigl( H(e^{j(\omega - \omega_0}) + H(e^{j(\omega + \omega_0}) \bigr).$$ Note that the bandwidth of the filter is not affected by moduation. Therefore, to obtain a bandpass filter with center frequency $\omega_0$ and mainlobe width $M$ rad/sample, we can do as follows.</p><pre class="codeinput">w0 = 0.3*pi; <span class="comment">% this is the center frequency of the bandpass filter</span>

Suppose now that we are interested in stopping a narrowband. Recall that if the filter is symmetric, i.e., linear phase, the frequency response is a real-valued function. Suppose now that $H(e^{j\omega})$ is a bandpass filter with a real frequency response and the maximum value of the frequency response is achieved at $\pm \omega_0$ with $H(e^{j\omega_0})= 1$. In this case, the filter with frequency response $G(e^{j\omega})= 1 - H(e^{j\omega})$ will be a bandstop filter. But in the time-domain this means that $g(n) = \delta(n) - h(n)$. Let us check this.</p><pre class="codeinput">w0 = 0.3*pi;

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="FilterDesign_08.png" alt=""> <h2>Optimum FIR Linear Phase Filter Design<a name="9"></a></h2><p>We now discuss optimal filter design. There exist many 'optimal' procedures so let us first clarify what we mean by optimal. Suppose we are given a frequency response $F(e^{j\omega})$ and we are asked to find filter of length $N$ whose frequency response is as close as possible to $F$. Here, proximity to $F$ is measured in the following sense. If $H$ denotes the frequency response of the filter, we try to minimize the cost function defined as $$ C(H) = \int_{0}^{2\pi} | F(e^{j\omega}) - H(e^{j\omega}) |^2 d \omega.$$ For simplicity, let $F$ be real valued and suppose we are interested in designing a linear phase filter of Type-I. A filter $h(k)$ is said to be Type-I if $h(k) = h(-k)$ for any $k$. Notice that if such a filter is supported on $k \in [-K,K]$, then the frequency response can be written as $$H(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{k = -K}^K\,h(k)\,e^{-j\omega k} = \sum_{k=0}^K\,a_k\,\cos(k\omega),$$ where $a_0 = h(0)$ and $a_k = 2 h(k)$ for $0&lt; k \leq K$. Therefore the minimization problem can be expressed in terms of the  vector $a$ as, $$ \min_a \int_{0}^{2\pi} | F(e^{j\omega}) - \sum_{k=0}^K a_k\,\cos( k \omega) |^2 d \omega. $$ The vector that achieves the minimum is given as (let me know if you are interested in how to solve this problem)</p><p>$$a_k = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} F(e^{j\omega})\,\cos(k \omega )\,d \omega $$ for $1 \leq k \leq K$, and $$a_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} F(e^{j\omega})\,d \omega.$$ Once we obtain $a_k$, we can easily obtain the filter coefficients $h(k)$ using the relation given above. Let us now find the optimal filters approximating the ideal lowpass filter with cut-off frequency $\omega_0 = 0.4\pi$. We note that we can find closed form expressions for $a_k$ for this example. But we can also compute it numerically.</p><pre class="codeinput">w = pi*(-1:0.01:1);

%% EHB372E Week-7 : Filter Design
% We discuss filter design this week. Although there already exist built-in Matlab commands for designing 
% filters (for instance 'firpm' - type 'help firpm' to see other related commands), we will discuss some simple methods.

%% Rect Filter
% Possibly the simplest lowpass filter consists of a sequence of ones.
% Specifically, consider the filter whose $z$-transform is given as
% $$ H(z) = \sum_{k=-K}^K z^{-k}.$$
% Evaluating this $z$-transform on $z = e^{j\omega}$, we obtain the
% DTFT. After some manipulations, we find that the DTFT may also be written
% as
% $$ H(e^{j\omega}) = \frac{\sin\bigl(\left(K+\frac{1}{2} \right) \omega \bigr)}{\sin\bigl(\frac{\omega}{2}\bigr)}.$$
% This is called the 'digital sinc' function. Let us sketch this to gain
% some insight.

K = 5;
w = pi*(-1:0.01:1);
H = sin( (K+0.5) * w ) ./ ( sin( 0.5 * w ) );
plot(w/pi,H); xlabel('\omega / \pi');

%% 
% The peak of $|H(e^{j\omega})|$ occurs at $\omega = 0$ and is equal to
% $2K+1$ (why?). The first zeros occur at $\pm \omega_0$, where
% $\omega_0 = \pi/(K+1/2)$. We will call the interval $[-\omega_0, \omega_0]$ the mainlobe of the filter.
% We also observe that $|H(e^{j\omega})|$ decays as we move away from the
% origin. Therefore $h$ may be regarded as a lowpass filter. This lowpass
% filter is controlled by a single parameter, namely $K$, the filter
% length. Observe that the mainlobe shrinks with increasing $K$. To see
% this more concretely, let us sketch the DTFT for $K= 7$ too.

K = 7;
G = sin( (K+0.5) * w ) ./ ( sin( 0.5 * w ) );
hold on;
plot(w/pi,G,'r'); 
legend('K=5','K=7');

%%
% If we normalize the filters so that the maximum value of the frequency
% response is unity, we can compare the more easily. 
K = 5;
H = (2*K+1)^(-1) * sin( (K+0.5) * w ) ./ ( sin( 0.5 * w ) );
K = 7;
G = (2*K+1)^(-1) * sin( (K+0.5) * w ) ./ ( sin( 0.5 * w ) );
figure;
plot(w/pi,H); hold on; plot(w/pi,G,'r'); 
xlabel(' \omega / \pi '); legend('K=5','K=7');

%%
% If we want to use this filter for processing a
% continuous-time signal, sampled at the frequency $f_s$, we need to convert the units of the frequency axis from 
% radians/sample to Hz. To do that, remember that $f_s/2$ Hz corresponds to
% $\pi$ rad/sample. Thus the mainlobe of a rectangle filter of length $K$
% is $[-f_0, f_0]$ Hz, where $f_0 = f_s/(2 K +1)$. Let us now convert
% the unit of the frequency axis to Hz, for $f_s = 16$ Khz.
fs = 16000; % this is the sampling frequency
f = ( 0.5 * fs/ pi ) * w;
figure;
plot(f,H); hold on; plot(f,G,'r'); 
xlabel('Frequency (Hz)'); legend('K=5','K=7');

%% Bandpass/Highpass Filter From a Lowpass Filter via Modulation
% We saw that 'rect' filter provides a simple lowpass filter. If we need a
% bandpass or highpass filter, we can shift the frequency response of the
% filter in the frequency domain via modulation. That is, suppose $h(k)$
% is a given filter and $g(k) = e^{-j\omega_0 k}\,h(k)$, where $\omega_0$ is the modulation frequency.
% Then, the frequency responses of $h$ and $g$ are related as,
% $$ G(e^{j\omega}) = H(e^{j(\omega - \omega_0}).$$ 
% It follows that if $g(k) = \cos(\omega_0 k)\,h(k)$, then,
% $$ G(e^{j\omega}) = \frac{1}{2} \bigl( H(e^{j(\omega - \omega_0}) +
% H(e^{j(\omega + \omega_0}) \bigr).$$ 
% Note that the bandwidth of the filter is not affected by moduation.
% Therefore, to obtain a bandpass filter with center frequency
% $\omega_0$ and mainlobe width $M$ rad/sample, we can do as follows.


w0 = 0.3*pi; % this is the center frequency of the bandpass filter
M = 0.2*pi; % this is the desired mainlobe width
% w0 and M constitute the desired characteristics of the filter
K = round( 2*pi/M - 1/2) % solve for the filter length that comes closest to the given mainlobe width
k = -K:K;
g = cos( w0 * k ) / (2 * K + 1 ); % the filter
[G,w] = freqz(g,512); % use fft or freqz to view the frequency response
figure;
plot(w/pi,abs(G));
xlabel('\omega / \pi');

%%
% Note that the filter is of length $ 2K + 1 $ samples. If a wider
% mainlobe is sufficient, a shorter filter could be used (why?).
%
% To obtain a highpass filter with the same mainlobe, we simply set
% $\omega_0 = \pi$.

w0 = pi; % this is the center frequency of the bandpass filter

g = cos( w0 * k ) / (2 * K + 1 ); % the filter
nfft = 512; % number of points in the DFT
G = fft(g,nfft);
w = ( 0 : (nfft-1) ) * 2 * pi / nfft;
figure;
plot(w/pi,abs(G));
xlabel('\omega / \pi');

%%
% If we wish to view the frequency response centered around $ \omega =
% 0$, we can use 'fftshift'. But we should be careful with 'w'.

w = ( -(nfft/2-1) : nfft/2 ) * 2 * pi / nfft;
plot( w / pi , fftshift( abs(G) ) ); 
xlabel('\omega / \pi');

%% Bandstop Filter Design
% So far we discussed filters that pass a band of frequencies. 
% Suppose now that we are interested in stopping a narrowband. 
% Recall that if the filter is symmetric, i.e., linear phase, the frequency response is a real-valued function.
% Suppose now that 
% $H(e^{j\omega})$ is a bandpass filter with a real frequency response
% and the maximum value of the frequency response is achieved at $\pm
% \omega_0$ with $H(e^{j\omega_0})= 1$. In this case, the filter with
% frequency response $G(e^{j\omega})= 1 - H(e^{j\omega})$ will be a
% bandstop filter. But in the time-domain this means that $g(n) =
% \delta(n) - h(n)$. Let us check this.

w0 = 0.3*pi;
K = 20;
k = -K:K;
h = cos( w0 * k ); % the bandpass filter
maxh = abs(h * exp(-1i*w0*k)'); % the maximum of the frequency response occurs at w0 for this filter
h = h / maxh; % normalize so that the maximum value is unity
delta = (k == 0); % this is the delta function REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH notice that the origin is in the middle of the sequence
g = delta - h; % this is the bandstop filter
nfft = 512;
w = (0:nfft-1)*2*pi/nfft;
H = fft(h,nfft);
G = fft(g,nfft);
figure;
plot( w/pi, abs(H) ); hold on; plot( w/pi, abs(G), 'r' );
legend('Bandpass','Bandstop');
xlabel('\omega / \pi');

%% Optimum FIR Linear Phase Filter Design 
% We now discuss optimal filter design. There exist many 'optimal'
% procedures so let us first clarify what we mean by optimal. Suppose
% we are given a frequency response $F(e^{j\omega})$ and we are asked to
% find filter of length $N$ whose frequency response is as close as
% possible to $F$. Here, proximity to $F$ is measured in the following sense. 
% If $H$ denotes the frequency response of the filter, we try to minimize the cost function defined as
% $$ C(H) = \int_{0}^{2\pi} | F(e^{j\omega}) - H(e^{j\omega}) |^2 d \omega.$$
% For simplicity, let $F$ be real valued and suppose we are
% interested in designing a linear phase filter of Type-I. 
% A filter $h(k)$ is said to be Type-I if 
% $h(k) = h(-k)$ for any $k$. Notice that if such a filter is
% supported on $k \in [-K,K]$, then the frequency response can be written
% as 
% $$H(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{k = -K}^K\,h(k)\,e^{-j\omega k} = \sum_{k=0}^K\,a_k\,\cos(k\omega),$$
% where $a_0 = h(0)$ and $a_k = 2 h(k)$ for $0< k \leq K$. 
% Therefore the minimization problem can be expressed in terms of the  vector $a$ as,
% $$ \min_a \int_{0}^{2\pi} | F(e^{j\omega}) - \sum_{k=0}^K a_k\,\cos( k \omega) |^2 d \omega. $$
% The vector that achieves the minimum is given as (let me know if you are interested in how to solve this problem)
%
% $$a_k = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} F(e^{j\omega})\,\cos(k \omega )\,d \omega $$ 
% for $1 \leq k \leq K$, and 
% $$a_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} F(e^{j\omega})\,d \omega.$$ 
% Once we obtain $a_k$, we can easily obtain the filter coefficients $h(k)$ 
% using the relation given above.
% Let us now find the optimal filters approximating the ideal lowpass
% filter with cut-off frequency $\omega_0 = 0.4\pi$. We note that we can
% find closed form expressions for $a_k$ for this example. But we can
% also compute it numerically.

w = pi*(-1:0.01:1); 
F =  abs(w) < 0.4*pi; % this is the ideal frequency response.

% compute the coefficients by numerical integration
dw = w(2) - w(1); % this is dw REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH do not forget to include this! 
a(1) = sum(F) * dw / ( 2 * pi ) ; % the first coefficient
for k = 1:50,
    c = cos(k*w);    
    a(k+1) = F * c' * dw / pi; % the coefficient index starts from k = 1 !  
end

% form the filters of length 11, 21, 101.
K = 5;
h1 = [a(K+1:-1:2)/2 a(1) a(2:K+1)/2 ];

K = 10;
h2 = [a(K+1:-1:2)/2 a(1) a(2:K+1)/2 ];

K = 50;
h3 = [a(K+1:-1:2)/2 a(1) a(2:K+1)/2 ];

% frequency responses
[H1,w] = freqz(h1);
[H2,w] = freqz(h2);
[H3,w] = freqz(h3);

Fid = (w < 0.4*pi); % ideal frequency response

plot(w/pi,Fid);

%% Displaying the Spectrogram
% Last week, we discussed how to compute and display the short time Fourier
% transform coefficients. In order to display the STFT coefficients for this week's assignment, you can either use
% your own code or Matlab's built-in command 'spectrogram'. Try 'help
% spectrogram' to find out more about this command - the idea is
% essentially the same as the STFT function you wrote last week. Below is a
% demonstration on 'Glock.wav';

[x,fs] = wavread('Glock.wav');
% parameters / variables to input to spectrogram
N = round(50*fs/1000); % length of the window
win = hamming(N); % you can try other windows...
Noverlap = round(3*N/4); % this is 'N - hop-size'
nfft = N; % number of fft points at each time-slice (we imlpicitly used 'N' last week)
% compute the spectrogram
[S,f,t] = spectrogram(x,win,Noverlap,nfft,fs);
figure;
imagesc(t,f,10*log10(abs(S)));
xlabel('Time (sec)'); ylabel('Frequency (Hz)');

%%
% Note that the spectrogram appears upside down compared to last week (lower frequencies are on top).
% Also, we see the whole frequency content in this image, which is arguably too much information to display.
% In order to zoom into the frequency components, here's an alternative for viewing frequencies
% up to Fmax Hz.

Fmax = 6000;
K = f < Fmax;
figure;
imagesc(t,f(K),10*log10(abs(S(K,:))));
xlabel('Time (sec)'); ylabel('Frequency (Hz)');

%% 
% How could we place the low frequencies in the bottom ?
